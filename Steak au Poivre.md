## Ingredients:
- 4 (8 oz) beef tenderloin steaks, 1-inch thick
- 2 tablespoons whole black peppercorns, coarsely crushed
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1/4 cup brandy
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 1/4 cup chicken broth
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley
- Salt and pepper, to taste

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).

2. Press the crushed peppercorns onto both sides of the steaks.

3. Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add the steaks and cook for 2-3 minutes per side for medium-rare or until desired doneness. Remove the steaks from the skillet and set aside.

4. In the same skillet, add the brandy and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Bring to a simmer and cook for 1 minute.

5. Stir in the cream, chicken broth, and Dijon mustard. Bring to a simmer and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened.

6. Stir in the parsley and season with salt and pepper to taste.

7. Return the steaks to the skillet, spooning the sauce over the top.

8. Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the steaks are heated through.

9. Serve the steaks with the sauce spooned over the top.
